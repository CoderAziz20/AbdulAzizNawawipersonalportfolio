                            and Music, and was honoured with the ultimate trio: Tokoh Murid, Tokoh Akademik, and Tokoh Ko-akademik.

                            <p>Form 2 was a year of steady effort and quiet hustle. I 
                            stayed focused and learned from every challenge. Alhamdulillah, 
                            that dedication led to me earning Best Subject Awards in English, 
                            Mathematics, Pendidikan Islam, Asas Sains Komputer, and Geografi. 
                            To top it off, I was awarded the Top Student in my Batch — a 
                            reminder that staying consistent does pay off, slowly but surely.
